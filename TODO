* Research which OSS license the app should have and that we adhere to the licenses of APIs.

* Resize the show posters on the API side to increase download speeds
* Add 'default' episode thumbnail per show (in case episode thumbnail is missing)
* Create show poster thumbnails once and cache it (on the Episode for now)
* URL encode the username in the API url?
* We don't need the poster URL in the JSON if we can inflect it by tvDB id.
* We need a calendar feed for not registered/signed-in users like the site has.
* Handle connection errors in some way which is needed to provide a good UX. I.e. should we retry, take a failure block, etc.
* There appears to be a timezone bug, as on monday morning I still see listings for sunday the 23rd, although the listings *might* still be correct, the date at the very least has to be localized. I've included a screenshot of the listing on monday 24th of january at 10:30AM.
* Expire poster cache?
* Settings screen to enter username
* Way to check if username exists
* Add load screen
