* Research which OSS license the app should have and that we adhere to the licenses of APIs.

* Add a 'Show' entry to an episode's details view, but only if it's loaded from the calendar.
* Add a Show property to a Episode, which holds the show related data that we now store on the episode itself
* Resize the show posters on the API side to increase download speeds
* Set the preferred show poster thumb size from the calendar controller
* URL encode the username in the API url?
* We need a calendar feed for not registered/signed-in users like the site has.
* Handle connection errors in some way which is needed to provide a good UX. I.e. should we retry, take a failure block, etc.
* Settings screen to enter username
* Way to check if username exists
* Add load screen

Caching
-------

* Cache calendar feed until end of current day. This might only mean that series that have just been added might not show up in the feed until tomorrow. Does trakt.tv even update the calendar feed that fast, though?
* Do posters for shows ever change? Or should we just cache them 'indefinitely'?
* Do Show thumbs ever change? Or should we just cache them 'indefinitely'?
* Caching Episode thumbs too long is probably useless, as one probably isn't going to look at the same episode details too often.

API extensions needed
---------------------

* A calendar feed for users that aren't signed in or aren't registered trakt.tv users
* The show-summary feed should include all seasons/episodes
* Show feeds for ‘trending’, ‘highest rated’, and ‘most watched’. PS what does ‘trending’ mean?
* Show search
