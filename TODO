* Create a simple webrick server that's used for testing API and HTTPDownload classes


* Calendar API:
  * We need the poster image url that's available in the show summary data
  * We need the url of the episode specific image that's show on an episode's overview on the site.
    E.g.: http://assets.trakt.tv/images/episodes/87-3-11.jpg from http://trakt.tv/show/fringe/season/3/episode/11
  * We need the channel on which the episode will air
* There appears to be a timezone bug, as on monday morning I still see listings for sunday the 23rd, although the listings *might* still be correct, the date at the very least has to be localized. I've included a screenshot of the listing on monday 24th of january at 10:30AM.
* Expire poster cache?
* Settings screen to enter username
* Way to check if username exists
* Add load screen
