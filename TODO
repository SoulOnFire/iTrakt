* Research which OSS license the app should have and that we adhere to the licenses of APIs.

* Sort episodes in the calendar view by air time.
* Add a Show property to a Episode, which holds the show related data that we now store on the episode itself
* Resize the show posters on the API side to increase download speeds
* Create show poster thumbnails once and cache it (on the Episode for now)
* Set the preferred show poster thumb size from the calendar controller
* URL encode the username in the API url?
* We need a calendar feed for not registered/signed-in users like the site has.
* Handle connection errors in some way which is needed to provide a good UX. I.e. should we retry, take a failure block, etc.
* Expire poster cache?
* Settings screen to enter username
* Way to check if username exists
* Add load screen

API extensions needed
---------------------

* A calendar feed for users that aren't signed in or aren't registered trakt.tv users
* The show-summary feed should include all seasons/episodes
* Show feeds for ‘trending’, ‘highest rated’, and ‘most watched’. PS what does ‘trending’ mean?
* Show search
