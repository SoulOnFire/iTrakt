* Calendar API:
  * We need the poster image url that's available in the show summary data
  * We need the channel on which the episode will air
* There appears to be a timezone bug, as on monday morning I still see listings for sunday the 23rd, although the listings *might* still be correct, the date at the very least has to be localized. I've included a screenshot of the listing on monday 24th of january at 10:30AM.
* Expire poster cache?
* Settings screen to enter username
* Way to check if username exists
* Add load screen
