* Research which OSS license the app should have and that we adhere to the licenses of APIs.
  TVDB: http://forums.thetvdb.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=2507

* The API should return whether or not the user has seen the episode in the show json.
* Add a 'Show' entry to an episode's details view, but only if it's loaded from the calendar.
* Add a Show property to a Episode, which holds the show related data that we now store on the episode itself
* Resize the show posters on the API side to increase download speeds
* Set the preferred show poster thumb size from the calendar controller
* URL encode the username in the API url?
* We need a calendar feed for not registered/signed-in users like the site has.
* Handle connection errors in some way which is needed to provide a good UX. I.e. should we retry, take a failure block, etc.
* Settings screen to enter username
* Way to check if username exists
* Add load screen

Design discussion
-----------------

* All lists should be searchable (filter)
* All top-level views should have a reload button

* First launch: load calendar, then visible row images + library & trending feeds
* Not first launch, i.e. the app was inactive, or the user hits the 'reload' button: reload _all_ feeds, but load the current visible one first.

* Calendar text:
    7x22: Show title
    Episode title
    9 PM on ABC

* Use default trakt image for when images aren't loaded yet (pass default image to Thijs for editing)

* Shows that the user has in her library should *not* show up in 'trending'

* The trending view should have images *and* have the following text, where the first part is an excerpt of the description like Mail does for emails:
    How I Met Your Mother is a comedy about Ted and how he fell…
    Genre Comedy
    <3 96%

* The library view should not have images. This is the user's library, so she'll recognize shows by name. This also makes it easy to differentiate between library/trending.

* The show details view should have a disclosure entry that says how many episodes there are in total: Episodes (23) >
* The seasons/episodes table view should have season groups like the calendar view, with episode entries like: [√] Episode title >
  The checkbox should be like the one in Things.

* The eipsode details view should have a disclosure entry to the show's episodes list
* The 'seen' entry in the episode details view should have the same checkbox as in the episodes list. (The one from Things)

* Shows and show episodes list views should show a quick alphabetic navigation thingie when it makes sense. See the HIG.

Caching
-------

* Cache calendar feed until end of current day. This might only mean that series that have just been added might not show up in the feed until tomorrow. Does trakt.tv even update the calendar feed that fast, though?
* Do posters for shows ever change? Or should we just cache them 'indefinitely'?
* Do Show thumbs ever change? Or should we just cache them 'indefinitely'?
* Caching Episode thumbs too long is probably useless, as one probably isn't going to look at the same episode details too often.

API extensions needed
---------------------

* A calendar feed for users that aren't signed in or aren't registered trakt.tv users
* The show-summary feed should include all seasons/episodes
* Show feeds for ‘trending’, ‘highest rated’, and ‘most watched’. PS what does ‘trending’ mean?
* Show search
